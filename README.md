# Stock Hawk

Android application and widget to show current stocks' values and history. This project uses _Yahoo Finance API_ to fetch the stocks data and history. 


## Note

Due to problems with _Yahoo Finance API_ we have commented the history request call to api and included a mock class, provided by Udacity, to fetch the history.
